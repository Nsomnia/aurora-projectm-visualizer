3.  **Create a Feature Branch:** Work on your changes in a dedicated branch (e.g., `feature/my-new-feature` or `bugfix/fix-xyz`).
4.  **Write Clean Code:** Adhere to the existing coding style and conventions. Ensure your code is well-commented where necessary.
5.  **Test Your Changes:** If applicable, write unit or integration tests for your new features or bug fixes. Ensure all existing tests pass.
