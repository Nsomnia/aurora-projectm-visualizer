# GUI Development

The GUI is being developed using Qt6. The goal is to create a user-friendly interface for controlling the visualizer and managing presets.

## Current Status

The GUI is currently in the early stages of development. The main window has been created, and a dockable panel system has been implemented. The following panels are planned:

*   **Controls:** This panel will contain basic controls for the visualizer, such as preset duration and shuffle.
*   **Playlist:** This panel will allow users to manage a playlist of audio files.
*   **Visualizer:** This panel will display information about the current preset and allow users to rate and favorite presets.
*   **Settings:** This panel will provide access to all of the application's settings.

## Development Plan

The development of the GUI will be divided into the following phases:

1.  **Foundation:** Create the main window and dockable panel system.
2.  **Playlist:** Implement the playlist panel.
3.  **Visualizer Controls:** Implement the visualizer controls panel.
4.  **Settings & Configuration:** Implement the settings panel.
5.  **Advanced Features:** Implement advanced features, such as keyboard shortcuts and refined recording logic.
